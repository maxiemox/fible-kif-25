● Title: Fible.


● Basic Details: fible-Mruthula S - Ram Kiran Mohan - Anna Catherine - Music - Directors often describe music needs in vague, emotional terms like “make this feel more hopeful”. Composers need precise, technical instructions. This disconnect leads to confusion, delays, revisions, and mismatched scores which leads to misunderstanding, frustration, costly revisions, and uninspired soundtracks

Statement- Fible is an AI-powered music brief generator designed to assist filmmakers and music directors by transforming script excerpts into professional, composer-friendly music briefs. Built using a React and TypeScript frontend paired with a FastAPI backend, Fible ensures smooth interaction and fast API responses. The backend leverages models from the Hugging Face Transformers library, using custom prompt engineering to analyze scene emotions, characters, and pacing. Based on this analysis, Fible generates structured outputs detailing recommended instruments, tempo, and musical cues to guide composers effectively
